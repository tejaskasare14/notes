Important conclusions:
   - there must be atleast one except block if there is try block
   - if excption raised at any line(even in any block), then the code after that line will not execute
   - we can write multiple except block for one try block
   - when any excption raised, python creates its object and find its coresponding class in Except block
     if class found, then program will terminate/excecutes normally otherwise abnormally
   - if there is not except block for perticular exception (not even default except) then program will
     be terminate abmormally
