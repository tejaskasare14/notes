OOP
1.class
   - class is plan or bluprint for an object
   - class represents the properties and behaviours required for an object
   - properties : variables , behaviours : functions(methods)
   - method : when we write function inside a class, it is called as method
   - class can have 3 types of variables:
      1.instance variable
      2.static variable
      3.local variable
   - class can have 3 types of methods:
      1.instance method
      2.static method
      3.class method
   - ex :car
   - to create class, we have to use class keyword
   - class name must start with cap letter

2. object   
   - object is physical existance of a class
   - ex. honda civic

3. reference variable:
   - used to access properties and behaviours of an object

self :
   - self is always ponting to the current object
   - self is not a keyword. its just a word, you can use anything instead of self
   - self must be first parameter of a instance method in oop
   - self must be first parameter of costructor

comstructor :
   - constructor is an magic method in python
   - it it called as magic method, because, it get excecutes automatically when object is created
   - constructor is having fixed name i.e __init__(self)
   - self must be first parameter of costructor
   - consteructor is used to intialize instance varibale
   - if we are not providing any constructor, then python provides its default counstructor
