OOP : way of writting a program which includes class, objects, rv, ... etc
1.class
   - class is plan or bluprint for an object
   - class represents the properties and behaviours required for an object
   - properties : variables , behaviours : functions(methods)
   - method : when we write function inside a class, it is called as method
   - class can have 3 types of variables:
      1.instance variable
      2.static variable
      3.local variable
   - class can have 3 types of methods:
      1.instance method
      2.static method
      3.class method
   - ex :car
   - to create class, we have to use class keyword
   - class name must start with cap letter

2. object   
   - object is physical existance of a class
   - ex. honda civic

3. reference variable:
   - used to access properties and behaviours of an object

self :
   - self is always ponting to the current object
   - self is not a keyword. its just a word, you can use anything instead of self
   - self must be first parameter of a instance method in oop
   - self must be first parameter of costructor

constructor :
   - constructor is an magic method in python
   - it it called as magic method, because, it get excecutes automatically when object is created
   - constructor is having fixed name i.e __init__(self)
   - self must be first parameter of costructor
   - consteructor is used to intialize instance varibale
   - if we are not providing any constructor, then python provides its default counstructor

Instance varibale :
   - varibale whos value changes from object to object called as instance variable
   - Where to declare,access,update instance variable :
      - inside a class
         - in instance method and constructor by using self
         - instance method's variable get added to the memory only after calling that instance method
      - outside a class
         - using reference variable

Static varibale :
   - varibale whos value same for all  objects are called as static variable
   - only one copy of static variable is created
   - Where to declare static variable :
      - inside a class
         - inside a class but outside of all method (all 4)
         - inside class method using cls keyword or class name
         - all other methods (instance,constructor,static)  using class name
         - static variables who declared inside a method will be added only after calling thar method
      - outside a class
         - using class name
      - generally to deal with static variables, use class name only (or cls variable inside class method only)

local variable
   - the variable declared inside a any method without using self,cls, or class name are called as local variable
   - for temp use
