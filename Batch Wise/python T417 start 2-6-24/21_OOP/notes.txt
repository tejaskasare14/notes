class : plan or bluprint for an object
object : physical existance of an class
reference variable : rv is used to access proprties and behavious of an object
properties : variable
behaviours : methods
methods : function inside class is called as method
class name must start with capital letter
self : when we create an object, PVM brodcast the refence of an object to the methods present inside a class
       now, it is responsibility of every (instance)method to receive that object reference. So to receive and store the 
       object refence we use self.
       self is not keyword. you can use any word other than self
       self must be first parameter of instance method and contructor
       self is pointing to the current object
contructor:
       constructor is magic method in python
       magic method becuase it get called automatically when object is created
       used to initialize instance variable 
       instance variable : value changes from object to object
       name of contructor is fixed i.e __init__()
       first parameter of contructor must be self
varibles:
       instance : the variable whos value changes from object to object      
                  we need self to work with  instance variable
       class(static) :   the varible whos value is same for all object
                  this variables present outside of all methods but inside of class
                  this are also called as class variable
                  this are like global varible : any method present inside a class can access this variables
                  we need self or class name to access class varible
       local :    the varible present inside any method for temp use
                  we cant access this varibles outside of that method
methods in OOP:
       there are 4 types of methods in OOP - constructor,instance,class and static method

Inheritance :
       problem : to access members (variables/methods) of one class to anther
       solution: those classes must be in relationship
              1. HAS-A
              2. IS-A 

       HAS-A:
              when we want to access perticular member of one class to another
              we can achive this by creating object of required class
       IS-A:
              when we want to access all membrs of one class to another
              we can cheive this by creating parent-child relationship
              this parent child relationship is called as Inheritance
