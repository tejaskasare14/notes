module is python file, consist of variables,functions or classes but this python file (module) executes externally
there are 3 types of mudlues:

   2. external: which we have to download and use
   3. user defined: created by user/programer

   __name__ : this is pythons built in variable to check whether the file is executed as
               module or a simple python file
   if __name__=="__main__" : if the file is executed internally then this condition will be true
